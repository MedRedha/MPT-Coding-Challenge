## Purpose
We want to see your personality as a coder.

We want to give you the opportunity to show off. Are you awesome at debugging? Spotting the mistake when reading the error code?

Think of this as an opportunity to show us what you‚Äôre good at and what you like doing.

## Mistakes to avoid making when working on a coding challenge
There are several mistakes you can make with coding challenges. Some of these are small mistakes that are easily correctable, while others will leave you frustrated and unable to finish your assignment. We want to address these mistakes first, so when you‚Äôre done reading this guide, you know exactly what **not** to do.

Here are four mistakes you can make:

- Time management and scope creep
- Trying to learn too many new things at once
- Making too many assumptions
- Starting to code right away

So now that you are familiar with the not-to-do list, let‚Äôs dive into the fun part!

## Rules
- Do not rewrite the entire code. Consider it as a production hotfix.
- Do not squash your commits to preserve changes history and review better.
- Do not remove any of the already implemented components and functions.
- Do not install, add or remove any package or third-party dependency.
- Don‚Äôt try to get 100% completion with half fixes. A good fix doesn‚Äôt need to be fixed again üòâ


## Task
As you already understood, we‚Äôre not asking you to build a Web/Mobile app from scratch. We already did for you but it wasn‚Äôt our day to be honest.

We left several in-code mistakes, from structural to syntaxical and your task is to spot, list and of course fix them one by one until you are able to launch and run the app properly. In nerd terms, spaghetti code on the menu üçΩ

## Talk is cheap. Let‚Äôs show you the code
- Download and extract the folder we sent you
- Choose your favourite terminal & IDE and navigate to it
- The first command to run is `yarn`
- To start the metro bundler just run `yarn start`
- Once done, commit and push the project to a **PRIVATE** repository of your choice and make sure to give us access to it before sending us the link
- Well now, it‚Äôs your turn to shine & impress us üí™


## Expectations
- We are waiting for you to fix the mess and launch the app
- Don‚Äôt forget to list all the pesky bugs you found in the readme file, how did you fix them and why did you choose that particular solution
- Make Small, Single-Purpose Commits. Don‚Äôt push 20 file changes with one single commit
- At the end of the day, we expect from you to:
  - Run and launch the app properly without errors
  - Clean the code from its memory leaks and boost performance
  - Be able to detect and display the listed device infos on the home screen
  - Hide the device status bar
  - Make the app rotate into landscape mode without messing the UI
  - Add a listener to the device theme so the app  switches automatically between Dark and Light mode without the necessity to restart and add the necessary support for the components (if applicable)
  - Be able to access, pick and fetch a document or a picture from the system storage and display its data after a complete progress bar
  - Make sure that **ANY** document type can be uploaded
  - Open the app automatically when running the following command: `xcrun simctl openurl booted NuriCodingChallenge://`


## The final UI
